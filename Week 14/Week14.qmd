# Writing the Research Report

*The outcome of research is the GENERATION of more RESEARCH QUESTIONS*

Knowledge is power!

## Anatomy of the Research Report {.smaller}

-   Title (10-12 words max)
-   Abstract (no more than 120 words)
-   Introduction/Literature Review (ends with RQs)
-   Method (participants, measures, procedure, design and analysis)
-   Results
-   Discussion (Implications, Limitations, Future Directions)
-   References
-   Appendices

## Titles

-   Keep it brief (10-12 words)
-   Be direct; Summarize key ideas
-   Articles with stylistic cues in titles were cited less frequently

Keating, D. M., Richards, A. S., Palomares, N. A., Banas, J. A., Joyce, N., & Rains, S. A. (2022). Titling practices and their implications in communication research 1970-2010: Cutesy cues carry citation consequences. *Communication Research*, *49*(5), 627-648. https://doi.org/10.1177/0093650219887025

## Titles {.smaller}

"This article **examines the 408 articles titled "Should I Stay or Should I Go?"** and asks why there are so many articles with the same title. The academic culture of publication pressure can lead to researchers choosing creative titles, including popular song titles, **to stand out from the crowd**. Furthermore, risk assessment leads researchers to choose the same songs as others, because well-known, easy-to-understand cultural references are better rewarded than more obscure references. The collective outcome of this, many researchers choosing the same title for their articles, reflects the mass production of cultural products, wherein **creativity is standardized and panders to the largest possible audience**."

Nieuwenhuis, J. (2022). Another article titled "Should I Stay or Should I Go?" or, the mass production of academic research titles. *The Information Society*, 1-7. https://doi.org/10.1080/01972243.2022.2152916

## Abstract

-   Often the only part that gets read!
-   Try not to overlook it
-   In many ways, it is the most important part of your article

## The Front End {.smaller}

-   Introduce the *problem first*
    -   Have a clear and distinguished project statement
    -   Include the goals of your study
-   Make it clear how the study contributes to new knowledge
-   Include a range of literature:
    -   What supports the Hs?
    -   What does NOT support the Hs?
-   Find the *FOCUS* and lead with this
    -   Testing theory? Lead with theory.
    -   Effects in a context? Lead with what we know in the context.

## Method {.smaller}

Ultimate purpose is to instruct the reader on exactly what was done to allow them to replicate the study under identical conditions.

::: panel-tabset
### Participants

-   State total sample size
-   Include demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, other relevant info)
-   State how they were selected
-   Can include power to support sample size if calculated

### Instruments

-   Describe operationalization of IVs and DVs
-   At a minimum, include reliability, means, and SDs
    -   If there is room, validity evidence is nice too
-   Try to have a sample item
-   For measures YOU developed:
    -   Pilot testing
    -   Factor Analysis and results

### Procedures

-   Design statement if necessary
    -   EX: Posttest only control group design
    -   EX: A 2 x 4 between subjects design
-   Discuss experiment in detail
    -   What was manipulated and how?
    -   Remember that goal is replication
-   What did participants do?
    -   IRB approved
    -   Gathered consent
    -   Answered questions

### Design/Analysis

-   What tests do you plan on running?
-   Missing data?
:::

## Results

-   *SUMMARIZE* the analyses
-   Support or show lack of support for Hs and RQs
-   Can include assumptions for tests
    -   Normality, linearity, equality of variances
-   Include the relevant statistical logic (pp. 567)
    -   Value of the statistic, dfs, p value, effect size
-   Avoid making comparisons or connecting to literature

## t test

![](images/test1.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

## ANOVA

![](images/test2.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

## Correlations

There was a \[negative or positive\] correlation between the two variables, r(df) = \[r value\], p = \[p-value\]

EX: There was a negative correlation between the two variables, *r*(33) = -.37, p = .029.

## Regression

![](images/test3.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

## Interpreting Results (Appendix G)

4 Things to consider with any test:

-   Decide whether to reject the null hypothesis
-   What is the direction of the effect?
-   What is the size of the effect?
-   Practical, clinical, or social significance?

## Discussion {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
### Purpose

-   Main purpose is to *situate results* in the context of the literature; relate them to what we know
-   Start with a brief review of the Hs and RQs and whether they were supported

### Implications

-   Stay within the confines of your results
-   Avoid overexplaining or making sense of something that was not tested
    -   "May cause"
    -   "Appear to influence"
    -   Do not use "approaching significance" or "proves"
-   A good approach to try is to explicitly compare results of your study with the *effect sizes* reported in relevant previous studies.
-   Hierarchy of importance:
    -   Substantive significance
    -   Scientific significance

### Limitations

-   Threats due to:
    -   Internal Validity
    -   External Validity
    -   Measurement Validity

### Future Directions

The key is to make sure limits and future directions are meaningful:

-   Follow up questions
-   New or refined procedures
-   Transfer from lab to real world
-   Propose new topics

## Discussion

![](images/Diss1.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Conclusion

-   What's the next step?
-   Sum up memorably

## References

-   APA format!
-   If you collect in EndNote or Zotero, it can spit out the reference list for you.

I like to find the source on Google Scholar, use their generator, fix it, then grab the doi.

# Presenting Results Visually

Can use Appendix F but APA manual is better if you have it (Ch. 7 - pp. 195-250)

## Visual Elements

-   *CLARITY* should be the primary concern of ALL Tables and Figures
-   If a figure does not contribute to a reader's UNDERSTANDING in a meaningful way -- leave it out!
-   If formatted correctly, visual data can be POWERFUL
-   Purdue OWL: [APA Tables and Figures Checklist](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/apa_tables_and_figures.html)

## Tables

-   Construction of the Table
-   Table Numbering
-   Table Titles
-   Table Headings
-   The Body of the Table
-   Notes to a Table
-   Examples (p. 563)

## Table Tips

-   Be selective
-   Combine where possible
-   Only discuss most important parts in the text
-   Work smarter where possible!
    -   Can use Excel to organize
    -   [Sometimes APA will organize](http://www.statsmakemecry.com/smmctheblog/how-to-make-spss-produce-all-tables-in-apa-format-automatica.html)

## Example Table

![Myers, S. A., Edwards, C., Wahl, S.T., & Martin, M.M. (2007). The relationship between perceived aggressive communication and college student involvement. *Communication Education*, *56*, 495-508.](images/T1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Figures

-   Should be easy to read and interpret!
-   Avoid any special effects
-   Example (p. 564)

# Peer Review

*Busting the mythology of Reviewer 2*

## Important Considerations

-   It is a privilege to be asked to review - take it seriously!
-   Rely on what you know
-   Rejecting an article is **okay**
    -   It honestly makes the Editor's life easier
    -   Have a good reason for it
-   Rejection is grounded in changes that **cannot** be addressed in a revision
    -   The worst thing for an author to feel that they could have reconciled the feedback

## Example Reviews

-   Revise and Resubmit -\> Rejection
-   Rejection
-   Acceptance

![](images/work2.png){width="400"}

## Tips to be a good reviewer:

-   Use *constructive* and *descriptive* feedback
-   Offer concrete suggestions
-   Acknowledge their work!
-   Provide examples
-   Focus mostly on big pictures issues

## Flip Side: Responding to Reviewers!

-   Be transparent
-   Address ALL concerns
-   Do what they ask unless there is a *really* good reason not to
-   Have citations ready
-   Highlight changes in manuscript AND letter
-   Make them feel appreciated

If you get to this point, it *should* be accepted

## Example Response

This is the *hidden curriculum*. I learned how to do this when I took qualitative methods as a second year PhD student from this same process.

## Memes!

![](images/meme1.jpeg){width="400"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](images/meme2.jpeg){width="400"}

## Remember!

Good researchers **support** and **justify** they decisions they made along the way.

# Wrap Up and What's Next??

After having your studies posted on the CI SONA webpage for at least a week, you should now have some data to begin exploration. This class period will be very applied -- demonstrating how to download your data from Qualtrics, organize the database, clean the data, identify outliers, gather descriptive, and prepare everything for analysis.

I'm turning you loose!
