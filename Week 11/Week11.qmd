# Housekeeping

## Project Timeline

Only 6 weeks left! 1 group has been approved by IRB

-   Goal is to launch survey within the next 2 weeks
-   Final Qualtrics survey needs to be completed by 3/27. We will prepare them to launch during the workshop.
-   Data collection will last *two weeks*
-   Group should be working on *front end* (literature review, hypotheses, methods)

## What Do You Know Now? {.smaller}

-   Research Design
    -   Internal Validity
    -   External Validity
    -   Measurement Validity

You can learn *a lot* about a quantitative study using just these!

## What Do We Still Need To Learn?

-   Analyzing **Group differences**
-   Analyzing Relationships

## What's Next?

## Overview of Today

-   Research Design and Classification
-   *t* tests
-   Analyses of variance (ANOVA)
-   Complex tests of group differences
-   Discussion: Group Differences in Practice
-   Workshop: Midterm Review / Workday

# GLM Ch. 18

*General Design Classifications for Selection of Difference Statistical Methods*

## Key Terms  {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset

### Between Group Designs

-   Each participant in the research is in *one and only one condition* or group
-   Participants receive only one level of the IV
-   DV only needs to be measured once
-   If power analysis says 20 in each group, then you need 60 total

### Within Subjects Designs

-   Each participant receives or experiences *ALL levels of the IV*
-   If power analysis says 20 in each group, then you need 20 total
-   Appeal is in need for fewer participants acting as own controls
-   Impacted by *carryover effects*

### Mixed Designs

-   Has at least one between-groups IV and one within-subjects IV
-   Has a minimum of two IVs
:::

## Understanding Design Types

It's all about the *levels* of the IV

Designs are usually described in terms of:

-   the general type of design (between groups, within subjects, or mixed)
-   the number of independent variables
-   the number of levels within each independent variable.

## What does this mean?

The researcher will typically state the design:

EX: A single factor design with 3 levels

EX: A 2 x 2 design with repeated measures

EX: A 3 x 3 x 2 factorial design

## Single Factor Designs

Note: *Factor* is another name for IV

Single factor designs only have one IV

EX: The effect of time of class (morning, afternoon, night) on student engagement.

EX: Students' perceptions of instructor effectiveness over time.

## Class Example

Ikeola and Marian are examining campaigns using visual images can influence HPV vaccine behavioral intentions and eventual uptake of the HPV vaccine.

-   IV: Visual message (4 levels: threat, efficacy, threat x efficacy, control) 
-   DV: Behavioral intentions

## Between-Groups Factorial Designs

Includes more than one IV

EX: The effect of time of class (morning, afternoon, night) and student sex (male, female) on student engagement.

This is called a 3 x 2 factorial design.

-   The **numbers** represent the number of levels (3 levels of time of class and 2 levels of sex).

-   The **number of numbers** represents the number of IVs (time of class and sex)

## Think Fast!

If you have a 4 x 2 x 3 factorial design...

How many IVs do you have?

What are the levels of each IV?

How many groups would you need for the study?

## Class Example

Elizabeth, Madelyn, and Ansley are examining how message sender status on Instagram influences behavioral intention / adoption.

-   IV: Status (3 levels: influencer, layperson, control) 
-   DV: Behavioral intention

This is currently a *single-subject* design. How would you make it a between-subjects design?

## Within-Subjects Factorial Designs

Two or more IVs

Participants experience all conditions

EX: The effect of teaching style (traditional or inquiry based) on student engagement over time (pretest and posttest)

## Example

To assess the CIS courses in the School of Information Science, we collect data from all course sections in August, December, January, and April to see if participation in course influences public speaking self-efficacy.

EX: The effect of class time on public speaking self-efficacy over time.

## Mixed Designs

"Such a design might have two between-groups independent variables with three and four levels, respectively, and have one within-subjects independent variable with two levels.

It would be described as a 3 × 4 × 2 factorial design with repeated measures on the third factor."

Basically, if it has a BG component and a WS component, it is a mixed design!

## Summing it Up

![](images/18.png){fig-align="center"}

If you recognize the design, you can generally determine the type of test needed.

# GLM Ch. 19

*The design classification ultimately drives the appropriate statistics.*

## Assumptions

::: panel-tabset

### Ask Yourself

-   Is it difference, associational, or descriptive?
-   What are the IVs and DVs?
-   How many IVs do you have?
-   What are the levels of the IV?
-   Is it a between, within, or mixed classification?
-   What is the level of measurement for each variable?

### Statistical Assumptions

Three major statistical assumptions:

-   DV comes from population that is *normally* distributed
-   Variance of groups must be equal (homogeniety of variance)
-   Independence of observations

### Remember!

*Data Analysis and Interpretation: Basic Difference Questions*

## Disclaimer

We are going to go through A LOT of tests.

I'm not going to show you *how* to run each one (i.e., what buttons to press)

IMO - it is more important to know which test is *appropriate* and how to *interpret* it. Once you figure out which test to run, there is a tutorial out there somewhere.

## Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
### Overview

![](images/Chi1.png){fig-align="center"}

### Focus

How does the proportion of smokers in our sample (observed) differ from the proportion of smokers (expected) in the population?

You need to know what to expect in the population (e.g., 20% are smokers; 80% are not)!
