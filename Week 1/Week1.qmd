# Getting Started

## What is "**The Law of the Hammer**?"

::: incremental
-   "When the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem begins to resemble a nail" (Maslow, 1962)
-   "Give a small boy a hammer, and he will find that everything he encounters needs pounding" (Kaplan, 1964, p. 28)
-   "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"

## The Method Behind the Magic

[The Magic Number](https://www.uky.edu/~drlane/cards.htm)

# Definitions

## Theory

"A theory is a set of interrelated constructs (concepts), definitions, and propositions that present a systematic view of phenomena by specifying relations among the variables, with the purpose of explaining and (or) predicting the phenomena." (Kerlinger, 1986)

"A theory is a way of making sense of a disturbing situation." (Kaplan, 1964)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Theory

Dubin (1978)

![](Images/Dubin.jpg){.absolute top="25" right="225" width="450"}

## Research

![](Images/Research.png){.absolute top="100" right="225" width="600"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](Images/Research2.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Research Methods {.smaller}

"The strategies and tools used to collect evidence necessary for building or testing explanations (theories) about that which is being studied."

**Research**: "Disciplined method of gaining new information, building knowledge, or answering questions; also called disciplined inquiry; implies a *systematic* investigation with underlying guidelines regardless of the particular research paradigm."

4 Broad Categories:

-   Experiments
-   Surveys
-   Textual Analysis
-   Naturalistic Inquiry

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Experimental Research

Purpose is to discover *causal* relationships between variables.

*Control* is a central characteristic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Survey Research

Purpose is to discover how large groups of people think and act.

Describes the characteristics of the respondents and the populations they were chosen to represent.

Focus is on beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Textual Analysis

Purpose is to describe and interpret the characteristics of a recorded or visual message.

Focus is on content, structure, and functions of messages contained in texts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Naturalistic Inquiry

Purpose is to study people in the situations where they usually interact, behaving as they customarily do when engaged in everyday activity.

Focus is on how people behave when they are absorbed in *genuine life experiences*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Our Focus

To make trusthworthy *generalizations*...

-   Samples must be **representative**
-   Response rates must be **sufficient**
-   Questions must be **unbiased**
-   Data collections procedures must be **uniform**
-   Coding and analysis must be **accurate**

# Purposes

## Theory Development {.smaller}

"The best research is driven by theory, validates a theory, further explains a theory, challenges an existing theory, or aids in the creation of theory. Theoretically driven research is built on the results of previous researchers, and it provides a foundation for subsequent researchers. It is highly unlikely that any theory could be formulated, tested, and verified in one research study. Rather, theory is developed and tested over time. What we come to know as 'the theory' to explain some phenomenon is the result of many research studies and the efforts of many researchers." (Keyton, 2001,pp. 8-9).

## Practical Application

A second approach to increasing knowledge within the discipline involves providing evidence for the efficacy of a curriculum, a therapeutic technique, or administrative change when there may not be a theory that would predict the results.

## Development of Research Tools

We also increase knowledge within a discipline by creating methods to assess behaviors.

-   A new scale to measure a latent (i.e. unobservable) concept
-   A new statistical technique
-   A new method of observational analysis
-   A technique for coding public data

# Dichotomies

## Theoretical vs. Applied

![](Images/Theory.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What do *you* want to do with your knowledge?

"Nevertheless, all studies have or should have some theoretical or conceptual framework and be based on previous research literature, even if the primary purpose is applied." (GML, p. 7)

## Quantitative vs. Qualitative

What's your *paradigm*?

A philosophy that guides how the research might be conducted.

It determines the types of questions you are interested in an the context in which they are examined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the postpositivist/quantitative framework, a specific plan is developed prior to the study.

In the constructivist/ qualitative approach, less structure is placed on the use of specific guidelines in the research design.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Derived from our metatheoretical assumptions:

-   Epistemology
    -   One truth \< - \> Multiple truths
-   Ontology
    -   Reactors \< - \> Humans as actors
-   Axiology
    -   Value neutral \< - \> Value laden

## Objective vs. Subjective

**Quantitative Data** are said to be objective.

Behaviors are collected and quantified with reliable instruments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Qualitative Data** are said to be subjective.

Behaviors could be interpreted differently be different people.

# Types of Research

## Approaches

The general framework for quantitative research includes 3 main approaches:

-   Experimental
-   Nonexperimental
-   Descriptive

## Experimental

The *randomized experimental approach* has random assignment of participants to the intervention and comparison groups and an active or manipulated independent variable.

The *quasi-experimental approach* has an active independent variable but without random assignment of participants to groups.

## Nonexperimental

The *comparative approach* also makes a comparison of a few groups on the dependent variables. However, the groups are based on an attribute independent variable, such as gender.

The *associational approach*, sometimes called correlational, has two or more usually continuous variables for the same group of participants, which are related or associated.

## Descriptive

The *descriptive approach* refers to research questions that use only descriptive, not inferential, statistics.

## Why does this matter?

The approaches really refer to the types of research questions that you will ask.

Categorizing helps researchers decide if a goal is to establish cause-and-effect.

It also allows you to directly follow the path from the general purpose of the research to the specific hypothesis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](Images/GML.jpg){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The type of question/hypothesis will eventually dictate the type of analysis that you conduct!

“The **research hypothesis** is the **bridge** between **theory** and **research**.”

-   Metatheory drives Theory
-   Theory drives RQs and Hs
-   RQs and Hs drive Method(s)
-   Method(s) drive Results
-   Results drive Discussion

## In Sum...

Methods are designed to promote the generation of theory, which can then be applied to help humans solve problems.

Quantitative researchers are interested in how an understanding of a particular communication phenomenon might be generalized to a larger population.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quantitative research:

-   Is *systematic*. It is intentional, replicable, and valid.
-   Observes, explains, and predicts
-   Tests theories that describe human behavior
-   Answers questions of **group differences** or **variable relationships**

# Content Part 2

## GML Chapter 14

**Ethical Issues in Conducting a Study**

-   Ethical Principles in Human Research
-   The Belmont Report
-   ORI / IRB Approval

# Ethical Principles in Human Research

## Historical Overview

Basically, people have done some messed up stuff. UK is not immune!

Led the federal government to establish regulations on the protection of human subjects.

It mandated that there be institutional review boards at each research institution accepting federal funding to determine whether subjects were placed at risk and, if so, whether the risks so outweighed the benefits and importance of the knowledge to be gained that the subjects should be allowed to accept these risks.

# The Belmont Report

## Principles and Norms {.smaller}

-   Respect for persons
-   Beneficence
-   Justice
-   Voluntary Informed Consent
-   Information
-   Comprehension
-   Voluntariness
-   Privacy
-   Assessment of Risks and Benefits

## Ethical Issues in Sample Selection

-   Cooperating Agencies
-   Response Rate
-   Dropouts

## Ethical Issues in the Methods Section

-   Deception
-   Debriefing
-   Experimental Research
-   Nonexperimental and Qualitative Research
-   Selection or Development of Instruments
-   Procedures for Data Collection
-   Confidentiality

# IRBs and How They Work

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](Images/Bullies.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am here to guide you through the process!

An IRB or human subjects committee is a group that reviews proposals for studies with human participants before the research can begin.

Week 4 Workshop will help you design your *research protocol*.
